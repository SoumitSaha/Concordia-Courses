The `on_state_starts` gets called at the beginning of each epoch and it is used to set up statistics trackers. The `on_stage_end` one is called at the end of each stage (e.g, at the end of each training epoch) and mainly takes care of statistic management, learning rate annealing, and checkpointing.

Change the JSON with the annotations needed for your task.\n","2. Change the data pipeline in `train.py` to be compliant with the new annotations.\n","\n","#### **Change the JSON**\n","This tutorial expects  JSON files like this:\n","\n","```json\n","{\n","  \"163-122947-0045\": {\n","    \"wav\": \"{data_root}/LibriSpeech/train-clean-5/163/122947/163-122947-0045.flac\",\n","    \"length\": 14.335,\n","    \"spk_id\": \"163\"\n","  },\n","  \"7312-92432-0025\": {\n","    \"wav\": \"{data_root}/LibriSpeech/train-clean-5/7312/92432/7312-92432-0025.flac\",\n","    \"length\": 12.01,\n","    \"spk_id\": \"7312\"\n","  },\n","  \"7859-102519-0036\": {\n","    \"wav\": \"{data_root}/LibriSpeech/train-clean-5/7859/102519/7859-102519-0036.flac\",\n","    \"length\": 11.965,\n","    \"spk_id\": \"7859\"\n","  },\n","}\n","```\n","\n","However, you can add here all the entries that you want. For instance, if you would like to solve a language-id task, the JSON file should look like this:\n","\n","```json\n","{\n","  \"sentence001\": {\n","    \"wav\": \"{data_root}/your_path/your_file1.wav\",\n","    \"length\": 10.335,\n","    \"lang_id\": \"Italian\"\n","  },\n","{\n","  \"sentence002\": {\n","    \"wav\": \"{data_root}/your_path/your_file2.wav\",\n","    \"length\": 12.335,\n","    \"lang_id\": \"French\"\n","  },\n","}\n","```\n","\n","If you would like to solve an emotion recognition task, it will look like that:\n","\n","\n","```json\n","{\n","  \"sentence001\": {\n","    \"wav\": \"{data_root}/your_path/your_file1.wav\",\n","    \"length\": 10.335,\n","    \"emotion\": \"Happy\"\n","  },\n","{\n","  \"sentence002\": {\n","    \"wav\": \"{data_root}/your_path/your_file2.wav\",\n","    \"length\": 12.335,\n","    \"emotion\": \"Sad\"\n","  },\n","}\n","```\n","To create the data manifest files, you have to **parse your dataset and create JSON files** with a unique ID for each sentence, the path of the audio signal (wav), the length of the speech sentence in seconds (length), and the annotations that you want.\n","\n","#### **Change train.py**\n","The only thing to remember is that the name entries in the JSON file must match with what the dataloader expectes in `train.py`.
